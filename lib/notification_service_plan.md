# Notification Service Improvement Plan

## Plan:

1. **Check Notification Channel Creation**:
   - Ensure that the notification channel with the ID `default_channel_id` is created in the `NotificationService` class. This is crucial for notifications to be displayed properly on Android devices.

2. **Debug Notification Permission**:
   - Add logging to the `requestNotificationPermission` method to confirm whether notification permissions are granted. This will help identify if the lack of permissions is causing the issue.

3. **Test Notification Scheduling**:
   - Review the logic in the `scheduleNotification` method to ensure that notifications are being scheduled correctly. Verify that the scheduled time is in the future and that the notifications are being triggered as expected.

4. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling in the notification scheduling methods to catch and log any issues that may arise during the scheduling process.

5. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, test the notification functionality to ensure that notifications are visible in the notification bar.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
